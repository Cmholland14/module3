let three = "3";
let four = "4";
let thirty = "30";

let addition = three + four; = 34 - because the variables are declared as "3" and "4" it concatenates instead of adding - when delcaring variable remove ""
let multiplication = three * four; = 12
let division = three / four; = 0.75
let subtraction = three - four; = 1

let lessThan1 = three < four; = true 
let lessThan2 = thirty < four; true
